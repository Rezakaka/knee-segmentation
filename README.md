# Abstract
Our study aimed to enhance subject-specific knee joint FE modeling by incorporating a semi-automated segmentation algorithm. This segmentation was a 3D Swin UNETR for an initial segmentation of the femur and tibia, followed by a statistical shape model (SSM) adjustment to improve surface roughness and continuity. Five hundred and seven magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database were used to build and validate the segmentation model. The masks for the femur, tibia and cartilages were performed by skilled users from the Zuse Institute Berlin "F. Ambellan, A. Tack, M. Ehlke, and S.
